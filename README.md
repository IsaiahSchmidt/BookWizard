 # **Book Wizard API**
### Isaiah Schmidt & Brandon Byrd ###
Our API allows users to add books to their library and rate them.
Books can either be created maually from scratch or by pulling data from the Open Library book API.
A brief description of how this works is included in the **API_Notes.md** file in this repository
Users can also filter through the books in their library by their *average rating* or *author*.

Isaiah primarily worked on Rating and Book methods, including GetAllBooksByAVGRating, CreateRating, etc.
Brandon primarily worked on Subject and Library methods, including AddSubjectToBook, AddBookToLibrary, etc.
We pair programmed a lot of methods, such as creating books from the Open Library API, with Brandon doing much of the heavy lifting on that particular method.
